## First, some context. 

When I began my college career, I had no idea what major I wanted to pursue let alone what job I wanted to end up with. I hesitantly joined the computer science program at Kapiolani Community College in my freshman year as a result of my best friend, who was taking computer science courses in Oregon at the time, saying that I would enjoy it even though I had never programmed a day in my life. My hesitation quickly turned into fascination and inspiration and has since driven me to become a computer science peer mentor, to perform summer undergraduate research in virtual reality, to continue performing research at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and to cultivate a passion that I’d never known before. Personally, the biggest draws of computer science and software engineering are using multiple languages and platforms together and solving technical puzzles to achieve a result. While it sometimes can drive me up the wall with errors, the drive to find a solution is considerably stronger.

## So, now what?

In ICS 314, I hope to gain a better understanding of what languages and platforms are best for a specific task and how to use a number of these to create a large project on a team. I’ve collaborated with students and faculty in the past but I haven’t worked on a team programming project before. The prospect of learning new perspectives and insight is exciting and I hope to hone my communication skills throughout the course so that I can be a more valuable member on future teams and endeavors. I’m not entirely sure what role I would be best in so learning my strengths and weaknesses will be a great lesson in determining what kind of programmer I am. Additionally, I hope to learn how to establish and maintain my professional presence and to also retain that spark of enthusiasm for the field that drives me to search for deeper understanding. 

## And after that?

My ultimate goal is to become a professor in computer science so that I can share the insight, eagerness, and passion that I’ve witnessed over these few years. I’ve always had this drive to teach, even when I was a little kid, and peer mentoring certainly pushed me to pursue this goal. I hope to find more experiences to help others and contribute to computer science, both in research and in education. When I performed research during the summer, everything I did was strange and new to me. I never used a video game engine, coded in a scripting language, developed a virtual reality application, nor worked in a computer lab but the patience and expertise of those working there encouraged me to keep pushing forward. Hopefully, I’ll be able to have more experiences to create and learn things I never thought I would ever work with and potentially be able to help the next generation of students.
